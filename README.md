# SimpleNet
I Created this simple Feed Forward Neural Network to classify Cats and fish.
I used four fully connected Linear Layers with ReLU activation Functions between each of them.

Note:
This project is inspired from the "Programming PyTorch for Deep Learning, Creating and Deploying Deep Learning Apps".
